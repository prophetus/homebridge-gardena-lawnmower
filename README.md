# homebridge-gardena-lawnmower

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin provides homekit support for Gardena lawnmowers. The requirement is a smart robot with [smart system](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/smart) connection (e.g. smart SILENO City).
The connection is implemented in the form of a fan, as Homekit does not yet support lawnmowers. When switched on, the robot runs for 3 hours (configurable via `mowingDurationSeconds`). Switching off means parking.

## Usage

Orginal was installed by: `npm install -g homebridge-gardena-lawnmower`

## Configuration
You can also configure this plugin via [ConfigUI-X's settings](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/wiki/Developers:-Plugin-Settings-GUI) feature.
